```go
i := 10
if i > 10 {

The program prints `Small`

**2. Write a program that prints out all the numbers evenly divisible by 3
between 1 and 100. (3,6,9, etc.)**  

**3. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiple
of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five
print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print
"FizzBuzz"**
