**1. How do you specify the direction of a channel type?**  

You can specify the direction of a channel using the function signature and the arrow signs:    
`c chan<- string` means that we can only send to `c`  
`c <-chan string` means that we can only receive to `c`  

**2. Write your own `Sleep` function using `time.After`.**  

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func sleep(secs int) {
	select {
		  case <-time.After(time.Duration(secs) * time.Second):
			return
	}
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(time.Now())
	sleep(3)
	fmt.Println(time.Now())
}

```

**3. What is a buffered channel? How would you create on with a capacity of 20?**  

A buffered channel is an asynchronous channel that does not wait unless is at full capacity.

`c := make(chan int, 20)`
