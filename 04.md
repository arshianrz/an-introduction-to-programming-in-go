**1. What are the two ways to create a new variable?**  

`var x string = "Hello"`   
`x := "Hello"`

**2. What is the value of `x` after running `x := 5; x += 1`?**  
6  

**3. What is scope and how do you determine the scope of a variable in Go?**  

The scope is the range of locations where a variable is usable. In Go a variable exists 
within the nearest curly braces.

**4. What is the difference between `var` and `const`?**  

With `var` we define variables the value of which we can later change.  
With `const` we define variables the value of which never changes.

**5. Using the example program as a starting point, write a program that converts from
Fahrenheit into Celsius `(C = (F - 32) * 5/9)`**  

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Print("Enter Fahrenheit degrees: ")
    var input float64
    fmt.Scanf("%f", &input)
    
    output := ((input - 32) * 5/9)
    
    fmt.Println(output, "Celsius degrees")
}
```

**6. Write another program that converts from feet into meters `(1 ft = 0.3048 m)`**  

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Print("Enter feet: ")
    var input float64
    fmt.Scanf("%f", &input)
    
    output := input * 0.3048
    
    fmt.Println(output, "meters")
}
```
