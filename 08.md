**1. How do you get the memory address of a variable?**  

We can use the `&` operator to find the address of a variable.

**2. How do you assign a value to a pointer?**  

Using the `*` operator we can assign a value to a pointer.

**3. How do you create a new pointer?**  

Using the `new` built-in function

**4. What is the value of `x` after running this program:**
```go
func square(x *float64) {
    *x = *x * *x
}
func main() {
    x := 1.5
    square(&x)
}
```

`1.5 * 1.5 = 2.25`

**5. Write a program that can swap two integers `(x := 1; y := 2; swap(&x, &y)` should give you
`x=2` and `y=1`).**  

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    x := 1
    y := 2

	swap(&x, &y)

	fmt.Println(x, y)
}

func swap(x *int, y *int) {
	temp := *x
	*x = *y
	*y = temp
}
```
