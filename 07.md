**1. `sum` is a function which takes a slice of numbers and adds them together.
What would its function signature look like in Go?**

```go
sum(nums []int) int
```

**2. Write a function which takes an integer and halves it and returns `true` if 
it was even or `false` if it was odd. For example `half(1)` should return `(0, false)`
and `half(2)` should return `(1, true)`.**

```go
func half(i int) (int, bool) {
    return i / 2, i % 2 == 0
}
```

**3. Write a function with one variadic parameter that finds the greates number in a
list of numbers.**

```go
func greatest(args ...int) int {
    max := args[0]

    for _, v := range args {
	    if v > max {
		    max = v
		}
	}
	
	return max
}
```

**4. Using `makeEvenGenerator` as an example, write a `makeOddGenerator` function that
generates odd numbers.**  

```go
func makeOddGenerator() func() uint {
    i := uint(1)
    return func() (ret uint) {
        ret = i 
        i += 2 
        return 
    }
}
```

**5. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as: `fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1, fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`.
Write a recursive function which can find `fib(n)`.**  

```go
func fib(n int) int {
    if n == 0 {
	    return 0
	} else if n == 1 {
		return 1
	} else {
	    return fib(n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
	}
}
```

**6. What are defer, panic and recover? How do you recover from a run-time panic?**

`defer` schedules a function call to be run after the completion of the function  
`panic` immediately stops the execution of the function  
`recover` stops the panic and returns the value that was passed to the call to `panic`
