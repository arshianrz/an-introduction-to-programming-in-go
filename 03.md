**1. How are integers stored on a computer?**  
Integers are stored using the binary system.  

**2. We know that (in base 10) the largest 1 digit number is 9 and the largest 2 digit number is 99.
Given that in binary the largest 2 digit number is 11 (3), the largest 3 digit number is 111 (7) and
the largest 4 digit number is 1111 (15) what's the largest 8 digit number?**  
The largest 8 digit number is 11111111 (255).

**3. Although overpowered for the task you can use Go as a calculator. Write a program that computes
`321325 x 424521` and prints it to the terminal. (Use the `*` operator for multiplication)**  
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(321325 * 424521)
}
```

**4. What is a string? How do you find its length?**  
A string is a sequence of characters with a definite length.  
To find the length of a string we use the `len` function.

**5. What's the value of the expression `(true && false) || (false && true) || !(false && false)`?**  
`(true && false) || (false && true) || !(false && false) => false || false || !false => false || true => true`
