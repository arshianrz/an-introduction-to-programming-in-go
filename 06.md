**1. How do you access the 4th element of an array or slice?** 

If `x` is the array or slice we can access the 4th element using `x[3]`

**2. What is the length of a slice created using: `make([]int, 3, 9)`?**  

`3` and the slice points to an array of capacity `9`  

**3. Given the array: `x := [6]string{"a","b","c","d","e","f"}` what would
`x[2:5]` give you?**  

`["c", "d", "e"]`

**4. Write a program that finds the smallest number in this list:**
```go
x := []int{
    48,96,86,68,
    57,82,63,70,
    37,34,83,27,
    19,97, 9,17,
}
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	x := []int{     
		48,96,86,68,
		57,82,63,70,
		37,34,83,27,
		19,97, 9,17,
	}

	min := x[0]

	for _, value := range x {
		if value < min {
			min = value
		}
	}

	fmt.Println("Min: ", min)
}

```
