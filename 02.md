**1. What is whitespace?**  
We can group newlines, spaces and tabs as whitespaces. These are invisible characters, mostly ignored by Go, but used
by developers to make programs easier to read.  

**2. What is a comment? What are the two ways of writing a comment?**  
Comments are extra information added by the developers that ususally explains the source code. There are 2 types of
comment styles in go:
* Single line: Using the characters `//` at the beginning of the comment
* Multiple lines: Using the characters `/*` to start a comment and `*/` to end it

**3. Our program began with `package main`. What would the files in the `fmt` package begin with?**  
`package fmt`  

**4. We used the `Println` function defined in the `fmt` package. If we wanted to use the `Exit` function from the `os` package what would we need to do?**  
First of we we would need to import that package:
```go
import "os"
```
And then we could call the `Exit` function like this:
`os.Exit()`

**5. Modify the program we wrote so that instead of printing `Hello World` it prints `Hello, my name is` followed by your name.**  
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, my name is Robert")
}
```
