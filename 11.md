**1. Why do we use packages?**  

To avoid repetition and allow reuse. Packages also provide namespacing.

**2. What is the difference between an identifier that starts with a 
capital letter and one which doesn't? (`Average` vs `average`)**  

An identifier that starts with a capital letter is visible outside the
package. The identifiers starting with lower case letter can only be
used/seen inside the same package.

**3. What is a package alias? How do you make one?** 

Go allows us to rename a package using an alias. This is usally done
to avoid naming conflicts.

**4. We copied the average function from chapter 7 to our new
package. Create `Min` and `Max` functions which find the minimum and
maximum values in a slive of `float64`s.**  

```go
package math

// Finds the average of a series of numbers
func Average(xs []float64) float64 {
	total := float64(0) 
	for _, x := range xs {
		total += x
	} 
	return total / float64(len(xs))
}

// Finds the minimum of a series of numbers
func Min(xs []float64) float64 {
	min := xs[0]
	for _, x := range xs {
		if x < min {
			min = x
		}
	}
	return min
}

// Finds the maximum of a series of numbers
func Max(xs []float64) float64 {
	max := xs[0]
	for _, x := range xs {
		if x > max {
			max = x
		}
	}
	return max
}

```

**5. How would you document the functions you created in #4?**  

Executing: `godoc golang-book/chapter11/math Min` and `godoc golang-book/chapter11/math Max`
